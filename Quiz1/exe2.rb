Describe the difference between ! and ? in Ruby. And explain what would happen in the following scenarios: 
1. what is != and where should you use it?
2. put ! before something, like !user_name
3. put ! after something, like words.uniq!
4. put ? before something
5. put ? after something
6. put !! before something, like !!user_name

- when ! and ? are after a method, they are part of the method name

1. != means 'not equals'
2. ! put before an object turns it into its boolean opposite 
5. put ? after something means you are check if that something is true
6. put !! before something, like !!user_name means turning an object into their boolean equivalent
